                    My hobby of collecting cute items date back to my highschool time, when my school was not far away from 
                    an accessories shop. I remember staying an hour in that shop just looking at different types
                    of notebooks, planners, cards and bookmarks. Now that there are even a wider variety of stationeries, such as water bottle,
                    powerbanks and DIY kits, I surely can stay longer than that.<br><br>
                    I am also a book collector, but quite a slow reader.
